## Abstract

Complex relations between cybernetic and physical components of a cyber-physical system (CPS) in tandem with continuous environment changes represent a challenge to engineering robust CPSs. To help engineers determine the cause of violations, there is a need for a systematic approach that helps understanding the system behaviors that lead to critical failures of the CPS. In this work, we present a methodology that identifies and isolates crucial anomalous behaviors that can not only hamper the system but also are often challenging to capture while engineering a CPS.
